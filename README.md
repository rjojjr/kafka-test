# Python Kafka Playground

This playground was originally created to test out different implementations of Kafka for python.

## Installing Kafka

1. `cd` into the `kafka` directory.
2. Follow the directions [here](https://bobcares.com/blog/confluent-kafka-docker-compose/) to clone kafka-all-in-one project.
3. From the `kafka` directory: `cd cp-all-in-one/cp-all-in-one`
4. Run docker compose to bring up the instance: `docker compose up -d`
5. To tear it down: `docker compose down -v`
